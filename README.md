## About
The Ticket Booking System is a Java-based application developed as a final project for the Object-Oriented Programming (CS 2365) class. Designed to allow users to book tickets for events like concerts, sports, and theater, this system highlights the use of Java and object-oriented principles to create an interactive, user-friendly experience. It provides an intuitive graphical interface for event selection, seat booking, and ticket management, utilizing Java Swing to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Description
The Ticket Booking System provides a console application experience for booking tickets across various events. Built with Java and Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI), it offers modules for event selection, seat booking, and user interaction. Through encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, the system models different event types (Concert, Sports, Theater), each with unique booking options. The interface is designed to streamline the booking process, making it easy for users to navigate through events and finalize ticket purchases efficiently.

### Built With
- <a href="https://www.java.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white" width="36" height="36" alt="Java" /></a> **Java**: The core programming language used for developing the system.
- **Swing**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI) components.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Design principles that structure the application, focusing on objects and classes.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/online-ticket-booking-system.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Build and run the application.

### Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Select the type of event you wish to book (Concert, Sports, Theater).
3. Choose your desired event, select available seats, and proceed to booking.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your booking.

### Contributions / References
This project was developed individually as a demonstration of the knowledge and skills acquired in the Object-Oriented Programming course.

### Learning Outcome
Developing the Ticket Booking System reinforced my skills in Java and object-oriented design. I gained experience in applying OOP concepts to create a functional booking system and honed my understanding of user interface design with Java Swing. Additionally, this project taught me practical skills in managing and structuring event data and optimizing a user-friendly booking workflow.
