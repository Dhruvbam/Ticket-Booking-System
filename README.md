# Ticket Booking System
![Alt text](https://github.com/Dhruvbam/Ticket-Booking-System/blob/main/tbs.png)

The Ticket Booking System is a fully interactive, Java based application developed for the Object Oriented Programming course, designed to let users book tickets for concerts, sports, and theater events. Built with Java and Swing, it features intuitive modules for event selection, seat management, and ticket purchasing. Leveraging OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, the system models different event types with custom booking options and dynamic pricing. With a streamlined GUI and strong modular architecture, it demonstrates the design and implementation of practical, user centric solutions in Java.

## Features & Technical Details

- **Object-Oriented Event Modeling:** Utilizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to represent different ticket types—Concert, Sports, and Theater—with unique booking options and pricing logic.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Java Swing powers a graphical interface for easy selection, booking, and ticket management. Console and GUI workflows are both supported.
- **Event Modules:** Modular code structure with classes for Concert, Sports, Theater, and Ticket, streamlining event handling, pricing adjustments, and seat tracking.
- **Interactive Booking Workflow:** Step-by-step user prompts for ticket type, seat, venue, and booking detail with error-checking for valid inputs.
- **Dynamic Price Adjustment:** Ticket price adjusts automatically based on event type (standing, backstage, on-field) via overridden methods in each event class.
- **Seat Management:** Tracks seats booked per event and displays purchased tickets for user review.
- **Scalable Foundation:** Written with extensible object-oriented patterns for adding new event types and booking features easily in future versions.
